# My Portfolio Web Page - README

## Overview

This is the portfolio web page I’ve created as part of the second checkpoint. The goal was to practice the concepts we've learned, and I have used the following HTML elements and techniques:

- Semantic tags
- Video/Audio embedding
- Local links, lists, and tables
- HTML forms

The web page is structured to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate while showcasing my personal information and projects. I have made sure to use **semantic HTML tags** to enhance accessibility and SEO.

The web page file is named `index.html`.

## Features and Structure

### 1. Navbar
The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and includes the following links:

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Work**
- **Resume**
- **Contact**

These are local links (anchor links), which allow users to navigate to different sections of the page without reloading.

### 2. About Section
In the **About** section, I have provided an introduction to myself, detailing my background, skills, and personal interests. This section uses **semantic HTML tags** such as `<section>` and `<h2>` to structure the content.

### 3. Work Section
The **Work** section showcases my previous projects and accomplishments. I’ve used a **list** to display the projects. For each project, I included descriptions and links to related resources, allowing users to explore more about each project.

### 4. Resume Section
The **Resume** section highlights my education, work experience, and skills. I chose to format this information using a **table** to organize the details clearly.

### 5. Contact Section
The **Contact** section includes an HTML form where users can enter their name, email, and message. I’ve used the `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` tags to create this functionality. This allows potential employers or collaborators to reach out to me directly from the page.

### 6. Footer
The footer includes copyright information and a placeholder for social media links. It is located at the bottom of the page.

## Additional Features

- **Audio/Video**: I have included a video/audio element to make the page more interactive. The video is embedded using the `<video>` tag.
  
- **Semantic Tags**: I used semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to improve the structure and accessibility of the webpage.

- **Responsive Design**: Although the page does not include a full CSS layout, I ensured the HTML structure was clean and adaptable to different screen sizes by using standard practices.

## File

- **File Name**: `index.html`
- The HTML file is properly structured and passes validation.

## Conclusion

I believe this project demonstrates my understanding of the concepts taught so far, including semantic HTML, forms, and navigation. I made sure to follow the instructions closely while adding my own touch to the design and content.

Please review the page, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
