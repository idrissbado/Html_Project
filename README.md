# README: Portfolio Web Page

## What You're Aiming For

Welcome to your second checkpoint, and congratulations on making it this far! It’s time to put into practice what you’ve learned. For this checkpoint, you’ll be creating your own portfolio web page using HTML.

At this checkpoint, you will focus on recreating a simple portfolio structure with the following objectives:

- Use **semantic tags** to structure your web page properly.
- Add **video** or **audio** to your web page to make it interactive.
- Use **local links**, **lists**, or **tables** to organize information.
- Implement **HTML forms** to allow user interaction.

Here is a basic guideline to help you get started (remember, you should be creative and personalize your page):

## Instructions

### 1. Create the Navbar
Create a navigation bar at the top of your page with the following links:

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Work**
- **Resume**
- **Contact**

These links should be local, meaning that they should take users to sections within the same page when clicked (use anchor links).

### 2. Create the Sections
Structure your web page into the following sections:

#### About Section
This section should introduce you—who you are, your skills, and your background.

#### Work Section
In this section, display your previous work or projects. You can use **lists** or **tables** to organize the information.

#### Resume Section
Provide a summary of your education, professional experience, and skills. Optionally, you can add a downloadable version of your resume.

#### Contact Section
This section should include a **form** with the following fields:
- Name
- Email
- Message

Use the `<form>` element to create the form with the appropriate input fields and a submit button.

### 3. Create the Page Footer
At the bottom of the page, include a **footer** with your copyright information, social media links, or any other contact details.

## Requirements Checklist
